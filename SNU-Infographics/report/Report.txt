Load model : class LoaderObj.h ( can load an object with : vertex, normal, texture, material )
Load texture : LoaderTextureJPG.h ( can load a texture/image JPG with help of SOIL.h )
Loader Shader : class LoaderShader.h ( can load a shader from a file)

PS : In this project, we have only one shadowmap, so if an object is not in the shadow map (target on origin), no shadow will be calculated.

You can actually change the object by modifying line 97 and 98 :
std::string nameFolderObj = "Farmhouse/";
std::string nameObj = "farmhouse_obj.obj";
PS : If the model does not appear on your screen, he may be too small or too big (change the Scale of model : line 35)
